## Project Summary

Our version of Super Smash Bros. in Minecraft utilizes our knowledge to create a multi-agent combat system. The overall goal for the whole project is to now have two agents successfully fight to try and knock the other off the stage to win. We have been experimenting with different methods(Q-learning and NEAT), and hope to decide on one method soon to complete the project with that chosen method. The goal for this status milestone was to have one stationary agent, and one trained agent. This trained agent is supposed to move to the enemy, and attack to knock the enemy off. Our environment is flat stage of 11 x 11 diamond blocks above a world of lava. If we still have time, once our project is complete, we intend to make the environment more complex. Lastly, we hope to improve the agent training of whatever method we decide on.
